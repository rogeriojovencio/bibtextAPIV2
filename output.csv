35412,,CONIC OPTIMIZATION,,,,,"[{'affiliation': 'Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira in Colombia', 'full_name': 'Alejandro Garces', 'author_order': 1}]",,"A conic optimization problem minimizes a convex function over the intersection of an affine subspace and a convex cone. Two particular types of convex cones are relevant in power systems operation: the cone generated by semidefinite matrices and the second‐order cone. This chapter identifies the main features related to semidefinite and second‐order cone optimization. It helps the student to transform optimization problems into standard SDP or SOC models and to solve SDP and SOC problems using Python. Some aspects associated with polynomial optimization and, in particular, the sum‐of‐squares problems are also presented. The chapter reviews some basic concepts from matrix algebra.",2022.0,,10.1002/9781119747291.ch5
