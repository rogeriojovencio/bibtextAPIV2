Two particular types of convex cones are relevant in power systems operation: the cone generated by semidefinite matrices and the second\u2010order cone. This chapter identifies the main features related to semidefinite and second\u2010order cone optimization. It helps the student to transform optimization problems into standard SDP or SOC models and to solve SDP and SOC problems using Python. Some aspects associated with polynomial optimization and, in particular, the sum\u2010of\u2010squares problems are also presented. The chapter reviews some basic concepts from matrix algebra.","year":2022.0,"type_publication_y":null,"doi":"10.1002\/9781119747291.ch5"}]
